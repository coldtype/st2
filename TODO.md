- Control to stagger letters in a given dimension (to create stair-case effect), though this probably needs to be part of the "export glyphs" functionality for simplicity's sake

- Control to emboss letters (would require two extrusion controls)

- Control to export "layers" of a color font (unstyled?), with option to stagger them in a certain dimension, so a layered color font is automatically a 3d font


- better physics controls
    - either in ST2 or a separate panel, for setting lots of physics properties at once
    +++ - or even randomizing things like bounciness over a selected set of objects


+++ - get variable font offset working for non-animated stuff



- control to align multiple instances together as if they were words in a lock up or something (maybe with some kind of width control)
