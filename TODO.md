- Control to stagger letters in a given dimension (to create stair-case effect), though this probably needs to be part of the "export glyphs" functionality for simplicity's sake

- Control to emboss letters (would require two extrusion controls)

- Control to export "layers" of a color font (unstyled?), with option to stagger them in a certain dimension, so a layered color font is automatically a 3d font

- justification of words? (ala the line-crunching example)


- better/easier exporting/tweaking workflow
    - maybe a button in unselected-mode ST2 that says like "Export All" or something?
    - that way you don't even have to select before exporting

- better physics controls
    - either in ST2 or a separate panel, for setting lots of physics properties at once
    - or even randomizing things like bounciness over a selected set of objects

- export multiple st2s from a single button (possible?)

- get variable font offset working for non-animated stuff
